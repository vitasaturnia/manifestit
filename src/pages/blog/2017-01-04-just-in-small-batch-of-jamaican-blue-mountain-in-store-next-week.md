  Bij het maken van moderne websites ligt er veel nadruk op de snelheid van de
  website, niet alleen voor de gebruikersvriendelijkheid, maar ook vanwege de
  Google SEO beoordeling. Hoe sneller de website, hoe beter deze word beoordeeld
  door Google. Om snelle websites te maken is het allereerst belangrijk om
  custom websites te bouwen, dus geen gepruts met Wordpress of andere CMS
  systemen, deze zijn vaak bloated, ongeoptimaliseerd, sloom, en onveilig. Een
  custom website heeft als voordelen dat alles precies is gemaakt zoals het
  hoort te zijn, zonder onnodige elementen die de website sloom of onveilig
  kunnen maken. En uiteraard dat alles tot in de puntjes aan te passen is.


  De Jamstack is perfect om zulke websites te bouwen, met een static page generator zoals Gatsby, kunnen wij supersnelle PWA's (Progressive Web Apps) bouwen, met alle customize-baarheid en modulariteit (en dus schaalbaarheid) van React Javascript, en de super handige backend features en CDN voordelen van Netlify.

We expect the shipment of a limited quantity of green beans next Monday. We’ll be offering the roasted beans from Tuesday, but quantities are limited, so be quick.

Blue Mountain Peak is the highest mountain in Jamaica and one of the highest peaks in the Caribbean at 7,402 ft. It is the home of Blue Mountain coffee and their famous tours. It is located on the border of the Portland and Saint Thomas parishes of Jamaica.

## A little history

The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.

>Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.

This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the peak.

## What you need to know before trying
